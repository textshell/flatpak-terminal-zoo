This is a collection of flatpak·s for various terminal implementations.

This is primarily intended to aid testing terminal software with different
terminals.

These flatpak·s don't integration into the desktop at all. Run directly with
`flatpak run` after building the flatpak·s.

Requirements:

* [flatpak and flatpack-builder](http://flatpak.org)
* runtimes from [flathub.org](flathub.org)

Usage:

Basic usage:
```
flatpak run de.uchuujin.fp.termzoo.urxvt9_22 -e run-in-host
```

Each flatpak includes a script `run-in-host` that allows running
executables in the host without any sandboxing. Use this to run
your test executables.

Contributing:

Contributions are welcome. Please keep in mind that the flatpkg .json
files are generated by the generate.py script in each directory to keep
updating for all versions easy.
